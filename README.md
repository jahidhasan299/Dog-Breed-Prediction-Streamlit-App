# Dog-Breed-Prediction-Streamlit-App
The prediction of different kind of dog
To start this project  downloading the dataset creating the model and finding out the predection usin this model. We can optimize different hyperparameters in order to tune this model for higer accurary.This model can be used to predict different breeds of dogs which can be futher used differnt NGO's on saving animals and for educational puporses also.

In this project, we will see how to use Keras and TensorFlow to build, train, and test a Convolutional Neural Network capable of identifying the breed of a dog in a supplied image. This is a supervised learning problem, specifically a multiclass classification problem.
